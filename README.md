Project Idea
Our app addresses the problem of people having trouble choosing where to eat by narrowing down a list of restaurants by user preference and possibly randomly selecting one from that list.  Existing apps have lists of restaurants but do not help the user select a restaurant once they narrow their list down to a few restaurants.
